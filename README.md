Abstract

This study systematically investigates the surface damage evolution of low-heat cement concrete (LHCC) and P·Ⅰ cement concrete (PICC) under coupled bending stress and freeze-thaw (FT) cycles, using a self-invented stress-FT coupling test system. The line laser scanning technique (LLST), an innovative non-contact and non-destructive testing method, is employed to quantify multiple surface damage parameters with considerable precision. The surface flatness and average vertical displacement obtained by LLST show strong consistency with traditional scaling weight measurements, confirming the correctness and effectiveness of LLST. The experimental results demonstrate the exceptional superiority of LLST, which achieves a 0.05mm resolution in scaling pit depth detection. They also reveal that the bending stress-FT synergy accelerates damage rates by 200% compared to FT cycles alone, with stress contributing over 50% of total damage. Moreover, LLST demonstrates exceptional capability in detecting both early-stage micro-damage (less than 0.1mm) and localized extreme damage (LED), which conventional methods fail to capture. The variation coefficient is introduced to quantify the discrepancy between global damage and LED. A difference exceeding 500% highlights that LED can escalate to unpredictable structural consequences, such as sudden brittle fracture without any macroscopic warning signs, even when global damage indicators suggest that the structural integrity is still intact. These advancements establish LLST as an effective tool for real-time structural health monitoring, particularly for critical infrastructure in cold regions where coupled stress and FT threats exist. The study provides fundamental insights for durability design optimization and early-warning criteria development.
